var myName = 'Arya';
// var is short for variable, is the JavaScript keyword that will create a new variable for us.

/* myName is chosen by a developer. The word has no spaces, and each new word is capitalized. 
This is a common convention in JavaScript, and is called camelCase. */

// = means to assign whateverâ€™s next to the variable.

// 'Arya' is the value that the equals = assigns into the variable myName.

console.log(myName);
// Output: Arya

/* After the variable is declared, we can print the variable with: console.log(myName). 
This will print 'Arya' to the console.*/


/* Variables can hold any data type, like strings, numbers, and Booleans. 
They can also hold data types that we have not learned yet, like arrays, functions and objects */


var age = 27;
console.log(age)
// output: 27

var hasPet = true;
console.log(hasPet);
// output: true

var strength = '50,0000';
console.log("How much stuff can a variable hold?", strength);
// output: How much stuff can a variable hold? 50,0000
